== Description ==

Google News XML Sitemap plugin automatically generates an XML sitemap for inclusion to Google News.

This FREE plugin follows the newest (non-deprecated) Google News sitemap format!

The Google News XML Sitemap plugin automatically generates a Google News XML sitemap including new Google News sitemap style and newly required sitemap tags such as PUBLICATION_NAME, ACCESS and GENRES every time a post is published, updated or deleted on your site.

A News Sitemap uses the Google Sitemap protocol with additional News-specific tags.

News Sitemaps are specific to Google News. This plugin automatically publishes your XML sitemap at yourdomain.com/sitemap-news.xml for easy submission to Google Webmaster Tools.

Unlike other sitemap generators, this plugin does not require any coding expertise and can be easily configured with just a couple clicks.
