== Description ==

The “Google News XML Sitemap” plugin automatically generates a non-deprecated XML sitemap of your Wordpress site for inclusion to Google News.

This FREE plugin follows Google News’ newest (non-deprecated) sitemap format!

The “Google News XML Sitemap” plugin automatically generates a Google News XML sitemap including new Google News sitemap style and newly required sitemap tags such as “publication_name,” “access” and “genres” every time a post is published, updated or deleted on your site.

A News Sitemap uses the Google Sitemap protocol with additional News-specific tags.

News Sitemaps are specific to Google News. This plugin automatically publishes your XML sitemap at “yourdomain.com/sitemap-news.xml” for easy submission to Google Webmaster Tools.

Unlike other sitemap generators, this plugin does not require any coding expertise and can be easily configured with just a couple clicks.
